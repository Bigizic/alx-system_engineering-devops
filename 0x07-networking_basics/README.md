## 5-is_the_host_on_the_network:

Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:

Accepts a string as an argument

Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed

Ping the IP 5 times

Example:


	sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network 8.8.8.8
	PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=12.9 ms
	64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=13.6 ms
	64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=7.83 ms
	64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=11.3 ms
	64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=5 ttl=63 time=7.57 ms
	
	--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
	5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4006ms
	rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.570/10.682/13.679/2.546 ms
	sylvain@ubuntu$
	sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network
	Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}
	sylvain@ubuntu$ 
	It is interesting to look at the time value, which is the time that it took for the ICMP request to go to the 8.8.8.8 IP and come back to my host. The IP 8.8.8.8 is owned by Google, and the quickest roundtrip between my computer and Google was 7.57 ms which is pretty fast, which is a sign that the network path between my computer and Googleâ€™s datacenter is in good shape. A slow ping would indicate a slow network.
	
	Next time you feel that your connection is slow, try the ping command to see what is going on!
